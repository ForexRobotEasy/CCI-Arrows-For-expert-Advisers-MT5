# CCI Arrows For expert Advisers MT5

This code is for an indicator called CCI Arrows, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is used in MetaTrader 5 (MT5) for analyzing market trends based on the Commodity Channel Index (CCI).

## Indicator Description

The CCI Arrows indicator displays arrows on the chart to indicate potential buy and sell signals based on CCI levels. When the CCI value exceeds the specified CciLevel, a green arrow is displayed, indicating a potential buy signal. Conversely, when the CCI value is below the negative CciLevel, a red arrow is displayed, indicating a potential sell signal.

## Indicator Settings

The indicator provides the following settings:

- CciPeriod: The period used for calculating the CCI.
- CciLevel: The threshold level for generating buy and sell signals.

## Indicator Initialization

During initialization, the indicator sets up the necessary buffers for storing the buy and sell signal values. It also sets the visual properties of the arrows and labels.

## Indicator Calculation

In the OnCalculate function, the indicator iterates through the price data and calculates the CCI values for each bar. If the CCI value exceeds the CciLevel, the high and low values of the corresponding bar are stored in the respective buffers. If the CCI value is below the negative CciLevel, the low and high values are stored in the buffers. Otherwise, the buffer values are set to 0.

## Usage

To use this indicator, simply attach it to a chart in MT5 and adjust the CciPeriod and CciLevel parameters according to your trading strategy. The buy and sell signals will be displayed as arrows on the chart, indicating potential entry points.
